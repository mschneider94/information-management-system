# Information Management System

## Introduction

This Information Management System is (currently just the beginning, hopefully will change soon...) a dynamic solution to Store and View/Review all kinds of informations in flexible schemes.

The underlying need is mostly the same as with classic Document Management Systems.

Main concept for this project is not beeing limited to a singular view or structure for organizing informations.
Informations can be stored inside the system, encased with meta-data and linked to other (parent-) documents.
The system views informations in user-defined schemas.

## This project uses [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)

A lightweight and modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.6.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
